Smart Contract Audit
===============================================================================
Syntax Based Smart Contract Bug, Exploit Finder And Simple Patcher Modified From Grep Rough Audit - Source Code Auditing Tool

Smart Contract Audit is a simple script and signature sets that allows you to find potential 
security flaws in source code using the GNU utility grep. It's comparable to 
other static analysis applications like RATS, SWAAT and flaw-finder while 
keeping the technical requirements to a minimum and being very flexible.
